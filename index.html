    A series in literature and film is a collection of interconnected works that share a common narrative, characters, or setting.
    This format allows for an expansive storytelling approach,
    where each installment builds upon the previous ones to contribute to a larger, overarching story.
    By maintaining continuity across its entries, a series creates a cohesive and immersive experience,
    enabling deeper engagement with the narrative.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a series, recurring elements such as characters, locations, or themes help to weave together the individual works,
    allowing for a rich exploration of the story and its universe.
    This interconnected structure not only enhances the depth of the plot
    but also provides opportunities for complex character development and detailed world-building.

    For instance, in film, the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's novels,
    follows the epic quest to destroy the One Ring. Each film continues the saga of Middle-earth,
    contributing to a grand, unfolding narrative.
    Similarly, in literature, J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series spans seven books
    that track the journey of a young wizard and his battle against dark forces,
    with each book building on the story established in the previous ones.

    The purpose of a series is to offer a more profound and immersive storytelling experience.
    It allows audiences and readers to engage more deeply with the characters and plot over time,
    while also enabling the creation of a detailed and expansive fictional world.
    Through this extended format, a series provides a nuanced and evolving narrative that
    can captivate and retain the interest of its audience across multiple works.
